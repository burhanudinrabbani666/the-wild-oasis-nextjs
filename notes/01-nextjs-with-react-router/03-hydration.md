# Hydration

- 👉 Adds back the interactivity and event handlers that were lost when HTML was server-side rendered
- 👉 Watering the “dry” HTML with the “water” of interactivity and event handlers
- 👉 React builds the component tree on the client and compares it with the actual SSRd DOM They must be the same so React can adopt it!
- 👉 Common hydration error causes: incorrect HTML element nesting, different data used for rendering, using browser-only APIs, side effects, etc.
