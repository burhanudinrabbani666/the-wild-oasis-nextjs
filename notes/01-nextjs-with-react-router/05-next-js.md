# What is Next.js

- 👉 Meta-framework built on top of React: we still use components, props, react hooks, etc.
- 👉 Opinionated way of building React apps: Set of conventions and best practices regarding routing, data fetching, etc.
- 👉 Allows us to build complex full-stack web apps and sites
- 👉 Allows us to use cutting-edge React features that need to be integrated into a framework: Suspense, Server Components, Server Actions, steaming, etc.
